#plugin.script.MyBorg

MyBorg is a python wrapper around borg backup to simplify using it from other python scripts.

This is a kodi-addon, taking advantage of MyBorg. Hopefully a first step to 
make a OSMC-utils-kodi-addon-repo.

Update: This is a unified version of the plugin and MyBorg. Going forward this will be the official code. The addon can be used outside of Kodi still, for example called from a cron job for scheduled backups.

This readme needs a complete rewrite!
